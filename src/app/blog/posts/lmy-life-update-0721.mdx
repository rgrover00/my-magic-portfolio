## Overview

Mid-30s, three kids, and still typing away—this season of life has been full of milestones, both personal and professional. As of this writing, Everly is now 7 months old, keeping us on our toes (and smiling through the chaos). At work, I continue to grow within BCSD's NOC team, and I recently completed four new certifications with Extreme Networks—doubling down on my networking expertise while continuing to explore web development and self-hosted tech projects.

## Life + Work Updates

**Professional Development:** Over the past few months, I earned four new Extreme Networks certifications, expanding my skill set in areas like advanced switch configuration, management, and cloud-based networking. These credentials continue to support my role in managing secure, efficient networks and optimizing connectivity at scale.

**Web Development Progress:** I’ve continued sharpening my front-end skills with frameworks like React, Next.js, and TypeScript, often after hours (once the little ones are in bed). Whether I’m building UI components or tinkering with portfolio animations, coding remains a creative outlet.

**Family Life:** Ayla (4), Bryson (2), and Everly (7 months) fill our days with laughter, noise, and endless reminders of what really matters. My wife and I are navigating this stage as a team, blending daily routines with weekend getaways and occasional breaks to just breathe. Life is loud, loving, and full.

**Staying Current:** Between network support, self-hosted setups, and web builds, I’m constantly learning—because in tech, if you’re not learning, you’re lagging. My goal remains to stay adaptable, certified, and creatively fulfilled.

## Tools and Tech

- **Networking:** Extreme Switching, EXOS, Google Workspace, Azure AD, Okta
- **Development:** TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (Cloud Practitioner), Azure, Docker for self-hosted projects

## Challenges and Lessons

**Juggling Time:** With three kids under five and a full-time tech role, time is currency. I’ve learned to optimize even 30-minute windows for workouts, coding, or downtime.

**From Side Projects to Real Impact:** Small experiments—like my 2D portfolio built with Kaboom.js—have taught me how meaningful even playful projects can be when built with intention.

**The Value of Routine:** Whether it's a nightly journal, dinner-time device detox, or using Home Assistant to keep the house on track, routines have become the backbone of both productivity and peace.

## Looking Forward

The journey continues—grounded in family, driven by curiosity, and fueled by the desire to grow. I'm excited to keep learning, building, and sharing what I know. Want to see what I’ve been up to?
