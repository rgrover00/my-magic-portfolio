## Overview

Life as a mid-30s tech-loving dad is all about balancing family, career, and personal passions. Over the past decade, I've worked in telecom and cloud industries, specializing in optimizing IT systems, managing secure networks, and building scalable web solutions. Currently, I'm part of the NOC team at BCSD, where I keep the network running smoothly while exploring modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and TypeScript for personal web projects.

## Key Moments

**Career in IT:** My professional journey began in networking and systems administration, where I gained expertise in managing Google Workspace, integrating SaaS platforms with Okta, and streamlining IT processes for seamless workflows.

**Web Development:** I'm passionate about creating intuitive and user-friendly applications. Leveraging frameworks like Next.js and TypeScript, I've built solutions that solve real-world problems and scale efficiently for growing businesses.

**Family Life:** As a proud husband and dad of three (Ayla, Bryson, and Everly), family is my foundation. From juggling coding sessions with dad duties to sneaking in gym workouts, life is busy but deeply rewarding.

**Continuous Learning:** Whether it's earning certifications like AWS Cloud Practitioner or exploring new tools for development and security, I'm committed to staying ahead in the ever-evolving tech world.

## Technologies Used

- **Networking:** Extreme Switching, Google Workspace, Okta integrations, and Azure for IT system optimization
- **Development:** Frameworks like React, Next.js, and TypeScript for building scalable, responsive web applications
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS and Azure for deploying secure, scalable solutions to meet modern business needs

## Challenges and Learnings

**Balancing Career and Family:** Life as a tech-savvy dad means adapting to constant demandsâ€”whether troubleshooting network issues, diving into web dev, or handling a toddler meltdown. This balancing act has taught me patience, focus, and the art of multitasking.

**From IT to Development:** Transitioning between IT systems management and full-stack development has been a rewarding challenge, enabling me to bridge the gap between technical infrastructure and user experience.

**Collaboration in IT:** Partnering with HR to automate processes and integrating complex systems has taught me the value of cross-functional teamwork.

## Outcome

This journey has been a blend of technical expertise and personal fulfillment. As I look ahead, my focus is on growing as a web developer, being more social, and continuing to create meaningful, secure, and scalable solutions. Above all, I'm grateful for the opportunities to blend my passions for technology and family into a rewarding career.
