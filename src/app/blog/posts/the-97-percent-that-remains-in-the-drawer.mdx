## The 99% That Stays Behind the Scenes

As a mid-30s tech-loving dad and IT professional, much of what we create in the tech world follows the same principle as design engineering—only a small percentage of our work sees the spotlight. The polished final product is the result of countless iterations, troubleshooting, and discarded solutions. But what happens to the rest—the ideas, configurations, and prototypes that don’t make the cut? They remain in the metaphorical drawer, quietly shaping the path to success.

## The Value of Discarded Work

It’s easy to view unused solutions as wasted effort, but in truth, they’re stepping stones. Each troubleshooting session, failed prototype, or abandoned draft represents a lesson learned. Whether integrating SaaS applications into Okta, configuring network infrastructure, or automating onboarding processes in Google Workspace, the unused iterations are crucial. They highlight what doesn’t work and illuminate the path to solutions that do.

## The Iterative Journey

In my career, the “drawer” holds its share of challenges. For instance, while designing automated user provisioning systems in Google Workspace, early configurations didn’t meet security or scalability standards. But through testing and refining, I created a streamlined process that optimized HR workflows and ensured data integrity. Similarly, integrating various cloud applications into Okta with Google SSO required exploring multiple approaches before achieving a solution that simplified user access while maintaining robust security.

Each challenge pushed me to explore creative solutions, test the limits of systems, and rethink initial assumptions. The “drawer” is not about rejection but refinement—a testament to the iterative nature of problem-solving.

## Why the Drawer Matters

The solutions that didn’t make it often become the foundation for future breakthroughs. For example, an integration strategy that seemed impractical at the time might become viable as technology evolves. Whether configuring network devices, addressing complex policy configurations, or troubleshooting compatibility issues, these shelved ideas build a personal knowledge base—a repository of strategies and insights that inform future work.

## Innovation from Revisited Ideas

Some of the most impactful innovations are born from revisiting old concepts. An approach that didn’t work under one set of constraints might solve a completely different problem later. As someone who has integrated cloud platforms, optimized IT operations, and built scalable web applications with frameworks like React and Next.js, I’ve learned to value the drawer as a source of inspiration and growth.

## Final Thoughts

The finished product is the 3% that everyone sees, but the 99% left behind is just as important. It represents the problem-solving, resilience, and creativity that drive innovation. So whether I’m designing a network solution, troubleshooting software, or coding a web app, I know the lessons from the drawer are shaping my next breakthrough.

For anyone facing a roadblock, I encourage you to revisit the ideas you’ve shelved. That solution you thought didn’t work? It might just need the right moment—or the right problem—to shine.
